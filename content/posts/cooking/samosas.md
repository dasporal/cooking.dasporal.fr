# Ingredients for more or less 20 pieces

- 500g of minced beed
- 1 or 2 onions depending on preferences
- 3 to 4 clove garlics

- Sunflower oil (or any other high smoke point oil, matter of preferences)

# Recette

- Incorporate the spices to the meat and let it rest in the fridge for an hour or more. Take it out 15 to 20 minutes before cooking.
- Mince the onions.
- In a large pan, put a small coat of olive oil.
- Add the onions to the pan.
- When they start to cook, add the minced beef and break it apart with a spatula. Let cook while mixing from time to time.
- A few minutes before it's done, add the butter and have it melt with the stuffing.
- Let the stuffing rest for a few minutes before putting it in the bricks (use your preferred method, [guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkpF1wjQyr8)).
- In a pan, add enough oil so that the depth can cover one half of the samosas.
- When the oil's hot enough, add the samosas in the pan (don't overcrowd, in order to make it easier to flip them).
- Let cook on one side once it starts to harden and turns golden, then flip the samosa. (more or less 2 minutes per side)
- Enjoy.
